# üìÑ Kapodistrian Scientific Document Signing System

This repository provides public verification tools and guidance for validating the authenticity of scientific documents officially signed by the **Kapodistrian Academy of Science (KAS)**.

All official `.pdf` documents bearing the `SIGNED_KAS` stamp are:
- Authored by verified researchers
- Integrity-protected using SHA-256 cryptographic fingerprints
- Signed by the Academy‚Äôs private key
- Accompanied by `.sha256` and `.sig` companion files

## üìù Submit Your Paper for Signing

To have your finalized scientific document cryptographically signed by the Kapodistrian Academy of Science, use the official submission form:

[![Submit to KAS](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%93%9D%20Submit%20Your%20Paper-KAS%20Secure%20Form-2AA198?style=for-the-badge&logo=googleforms&logoColor=white)](https://forms.gle/oLhKr2KA17NPhSvr9)

KAS will:
- Stamp your PDF with metadata and cryptographic fingerprint
- Generate and sign the official `.sha256` hash
- Return a verified bundle (.pdf, .sha256, .sig) for publication or public release

## üîç What You Can Do Here

### ‚úÖ 1. Verify Official Document Authenticity

Use the included notebook to:
- Upload the `.pdf`, `.sha256`, and `.sig` files
- Confirm that the document matches its signed fingerprint
- Ensure the signature was issued by the **Academy‚Äôs public key**

---

## üìÑ Official File Naming Convention

All official documents follow this format:

```
[AuthorLastName]_[ShortTitle]_v[Version]_SIGNED_KAS_[Date].pdf
```

Example:
```
Valamontes_SpectralRealization_v1_SIGNED_KAS_2025-05-01.pdf
```

Each document is accompanied by:
- `[...].sha256` ‚Äî file hash
- `[...].sha256.sig` ‚Äî cryptographic signature

## üõ° Signature Verification Tools

### [`KAS_Verifier_OpenSSL.ipynb`](./KAS_Verifier_OpenSSL.ipynb)

Use this notebook to verify that a signed document:
- Matches its cryptographic `.sha256` fingerprint
- Was signed by the Kapodistrian Academy of Science
- Has not been tampered with

You must upload:
- The `.pdf` file (signed document)
- The `.sha256` file (hash)
- The `.sig` file (signature)
- The `public_key.pem` file (official KAS key)

üëâ Use the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Galactic-Code-Developers/kas-pdf-auth-verifier/blob/main/KAS_Verifier_OpenSSL.ipynb) for quick validation.

## üì• Official Public Key

The `public_key.pem` provided in this repository is the only accepted key for verifying KAS-signed documents.

Do not trust any `.sig` unless it validates with this key.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Trust Policy

- Only the **Kapodistrian Academy of Science** is authorized to issue `.sig` files.
- This repository does **not** include signing tools, private keys, or signing access.
- Public users may verify signatures, but may **not generate their own**.
- Documents without a matching `.sig` file and public key validation are considered **unauthenticated**.

---

## üîí Trust & Transparency

Official KAS-signed documents may optionally include:
- A TRIM-CERT evaluation certificate (scientific trustworthiness)
- DOI and author metadata
- Institutional footer from the Kapodistrian Academy of Science
